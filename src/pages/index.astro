			<p>
				I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Adobe, currently working on foundation models for video generation and editing within the Firefly team. Previously, at Rephrase.ai, I contributed to the Auto Dubbing and Lip Sync model by building a large-scale, diverse talking-head dataset. After Adobe acquired Rephrase.ai, this model was deployed on the Firefly platform.

				Before working on generative video systems, I was at Zomato, where I developed and deployed APIs for face recognition and liveliness detection, along with image enhancement and tagging models. I began my career at Samsung, working on gesture recognition, human action classification, and neural network based wireless signal compression.

				I graduated from IIT Kharagpur with a B.Tech in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering and a minor in Computer Science.
